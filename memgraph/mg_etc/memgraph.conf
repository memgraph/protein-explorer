# Memgraph Configuration
#
# This is the main configuration file for Memgraph. You can modify this file to
# suit your specific needs. Additional configuration can be specified by
# including another configuration file, in a file pointed to by the
# 'MEMGRAPH_CONFIG' environment variable or by passing arguments on the command
# line.
#
# Each configuration setting is in the form: '--setting-name=value'.

# of processing units available on the machine. [int32]
# --bolt-num-workers=

# message. [string]

## Memory

# Total memory limit in MiB. Set to 0 to use the default values which are 100%
# of the phyisical memory if the swap is enabled and 90% of the physical memory
# otherwise. [uint64]
--memory-limit=0

# Memory warning threshold, in MB. If Memgraph detects there is less available
# RAM it will log a warning. Set to 0 to disable. [uint64]
# --memory-warning-threshold=1024


## Query

# Use the cost-estimating query planner. [bool]
# --query-cost-planner=true

# Maximum allowed query execution time. Queries exceeding this limit will be
# aborted. Value of 0 means no limit. [uint64]
# --query-execution-timeout-sec=180

# Maximum number of generated plans for a query. [uint64]
# --query-max-plans=1000

# Directory where modules with custom query procedures are stored. NOTE:
# Multiple comma-separated directories can be defined. [string]
--query-modules-directory=/usr/lib/memgraph/query_modules

# Time to live for cached query plans, in seconds. [int32]
# --query-plan-cache-ttl=60

# Maximum count of indexed vertices which provoke indexed lookup and then expand
# to existing, instead of a regular expand. Default is 10, to turn off use -1.
# [int64]
# --query-vertex-count-to-expand-existing=10


## Storage

# Storage garbage collector interval (in seconds). [uint64]
# --storage-gc-cycle-sec=30

# Controls whether edges have properties. [bool]
--storage-properties-on-edges=true

# Controls whether the storage recovers persisted data on startup. [bool]
--storage-recover-on-startup=true

# Storage snapshot creation interval (in seconds). Set to 0 to disable periodic
# snapshot creation. [uint64]
--storage-snapshot-interval-sec=300

# Controls whether the storage creates another snapshot on exit. [bool]
--storage-snapshot-on-exit=true

# The number of snapshots that should always be kept. [uint64]
--storage-snapshot-retention-count=3

# Controls whether the storage uses write-ahead-logging. To enable WAL periodic
# snapshots must be enabled. [bool]
--storage-wal-enabled=true

# Issue a 'fsync' call after this amount of transactions are written to the WAL
# file. Set to 1 for fully synchronous operation. [uint64]
# --storage-wal-file-flush-every-n-tx=100000

# Minimum file size of each WAL file. [uint64]
# --storage-wal-file-size-kib=20480


## Other

# Path to directory in which to save all permanent data. [string]

#--data-directory=/var/lib/memgraph

# Set to true to enable telemetry. We collect information about the running
# system (CPU and memory information) and information about the database runtime
# (vertex and edge counts and resource usage) to allow for easier improvement of
# the product. [bool]
--telemetry-enabled=false


# Additional Configuration Inclusion
#
# You can include additional configuration files from this file. Additional
# files are processed after this file. Settings that are set in the additional
# files will override previously set values. Additional configuration files are
# specified with the '--flag-file' flag.
#
# Example:
#
# --flag-file=another.conf
