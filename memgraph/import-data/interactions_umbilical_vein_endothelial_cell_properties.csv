4216|MAP3K4|mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 4|The central core of each mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a conserved cascade of 3 protein kinases: an activated MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) phosphorylates and activates a specific MAPK kinase (MAPKK), which then activates a specific MAPK. While the ERK MAPKs are activated by mitogenic stimulation, the CSBP2 and JNK MAPKs are activated by environmental stresses such as osmotic shock, UV irradiation, wound stress, and inflammatory factors. This gene encodes a MAPKKK, the MEKK4 protein, also called MTK1. This protein contains a protein kinase catalytic domain at the C terminus. The N-terminal nonkinase domain may contain a regulatory domain. Expression of MEKK4 in mammalian cells activated the CSBP2 and JNK MAPK pathways, but not the ERK pathway. In vitro kinase studies indicated that recombinant MEKK4 can specifically phosphorylate and activate PRKMK6 and SERK1, MAPKKs that activate CSBP2 and JNK, respectively but cannot phosphorylate PRKMK1, an MAPKK that activates ERKs. MEKK4 is a major mediator of environmental stresses that activate the CSBP2 MAPK pathway, and a minor mediator of the JNK pathway. Several alternatively spliced transcripts encoding distinct isoforms have been described. [provided by RefSeq, May 2014]
1845|DUSP3|dual specificity phosphatase 3|The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the dual specificity protein phosphatase subfamily.

They negatively regulate members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase superfamily (MAPK/ERK, SAPK/JNK, p38), which are associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation. Different members of the family of dual specificity phosphatases show distinct substrate specificities for various MAP kinases, different tissue distribution and subcellular localization, and different modes of inducibility of their expression by extracellular stimuli. This gene maps in a region that contains the BRCA1 locus which confers susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Although DUSP3 is expressed in both breast and ovarian tissues, mutation screening in breast cancer pedigrees and in sporadic tumors was negative, leading to the conclusion that this gene is not BRCA1.

3913|LAMB2|laminin subunit beta 2|Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins, composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively), form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the beta chain isoform laminin, beta 2. The beta 2 chain contains the 7 structural domains typical of beta chains of laminin, including the short alpha region. However, unlike beta 1 chain, beta 2 has a more restricted tissue distribution. It is enriched in the basement membrane of muscles at the neuromuscular junctions, kidney glomerulus and vascular smooth muscle. Transgenic mice in which the beta 2 chain gene was inactivated by homologous recombination, showed defects in the maturation of neuromuscular junctions and impairment of glomerular filtration. Alternative splicing involving a non consensus 5' splice site (gc) in the 5' UTR of this gene has been reported. It was suggested that inefficient splicing of this first intron, which does not change the protein sequence, results in a greater abundance of the unspliced form of the transcript than the spliced form. The full-length nature of the spliced transcript is not known. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]

The protein acts as a tumor suppressor and inhibits epithelial cell proliferation. It may also have an inhibitory effect on tumors by reducing angiogenesis and increasng blood vessel hyperpermeability. The encoded protein is a crucial component of the bone morphogenetic protein signaling pathway. The Smad proteins are subject to complex regulation by post-translational modifications.

This kinase is activated by various environmental stresses and proinflammatory cytokines. The activation requires its phosphorylation by MAP kinase kinases (MKKs), or its autophosphorylation triggered by the interaction of MAP3K7IP1/TAB1 protein with this kinase. The substrates of this kinase include transcription regulator ATF2, MEF2C, and MAX, cell cycle regulator CDC25B, and tumor suppressor p53, which suggest the roles of this kinase in stress related transcription and cell cycle regulation, as well as in genotoxic stress response.

5094|PCBP2|poly(rC) binding protein 2|The protein encoded by this gene appears to be multifunctional. Along with PCBP-1 and hnRNPK, it is one of the major cellular poly(rC)-binding proteins. The encoded protein contains three K-homologous (KH) domains which may be involved in RNA binding. Together with PCBP-1, this protein also functions as a translational coactivator of poliovirus RNA via a sequence-specific interaction with stem-loop IV of the IRES, promoting poliovirus RNA replication by binding to its 5'-terminal cloverleaf structure. It has also been implicated in translational control of the 15-lipoxygenase mRNA, human papillomavirus type 16 L2 mRNA, and hepatitis A virus RNA. The encoded protein is also suggested to play a part in formation of a sequence-specific alpha-globin mRNP complex which is associated with alpha-globin mRNA stability. This multiexon structural mRNA is thought to be retrotransposed to generate PCBP-1, an intronless gene with functions similar to that of PCBP2. This gene and PCBP-1 have paralogous genes (PCBP3 and PCBP4) which are thought to have arisen as a result of duplication events of entire genes.

Both proteins bind the p53 tumor suppressor protein and inhibit its activity, and have been shown to be overexpressed in a variety of human cancers. However, unlike MDM2 which degrades p53, this protein inhibits p53 by binding its transcriptional activation domain. This protein also interacts with MDM2 protein via the RING finger domain, and inhibits the latter's degradation. So this protein can reverse MDM2-targeted degradation of p53, while maintaining suppression of p53 transactivation and apoptotic functions.

3837|KPNB1|karyopherin subunit beta 1|Nucleocytoplasmic transport, a signal- and energy-dependent process, takes place through nuclear pore complexes embedded in the nuclear envelope. The import of proteins containing a nuclear localization signal (NLS) requires the NLS import receptor, a heterodimer of importin alpha and beta subunits also known as karyopherins. Importin alpha binds the NLS-containing cargo in the cytoplasm and importin beta docks the complex at the cytoplasmic side of the nuclear pore complex. In the presence of nucleoside triphosphates and the small GTP binding protein Ran, the complex moves into the nuclear pore complex and the importin subunits dissociate. Importin alpha enters the nucleoplasm with its passenger protein and importin beta remains at the pore. Interactions between importin beta and the FG repeats of nucleoporins are essential in translocation through the pore complex.

6521|SLC4A1|solute carrier family 4 member 1 (Diego blood group)|The protein encoded by this gene is part of the anion exchanger (AE) family and is expressed in the erythrocyte plasma membrane, where it functions as a chloride/bicarbonate exchanger involved in carbon dioxide transport from tissues to lungs. The protein comprises two domains that are structurally and functionally distinct. The N-terminal 40kDa domain is located in the cytoplasm and acts as an attachment site for the red cell skeleton by binding ankyrin. The glycosylated C-terminal membrane-associated domain contains 12-14 membrane spanning segments and carries out the stilbene disulphonate-sensitive exchange transport of anions. The cytoplasmic tail at the extreme C-terminus of the membrane domain binds carbonic anhydrase II. The encoded protein associates with the red cell membrane protein glycophorin A and this association promotes the correct folding and translocation of the exchanger. This protein is predominantly dimeric but forms tetramers in the presence of ankyrin. Many mutations in this gene are known in man, and these mutations can lead to two types of disease: destabilization of red cell membrane leading to hereditary spherocytosis, and defective kidney acid secretion leading to distal renal tubular acidosis. Other mutations that do not give rise to disease result in novel blood group antigens, which form the Diego blood group system. Southeast Asian ovalocytosis (SAO, Melanesian ovalocytosis) results from the heterozygous presence of a deletion in the encoded protein and is common in areas where Plasmodium falciparum malaria is endemic.

Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the beta chain isoform laminin, beta 1. The beta 1 chain has 7 structurally distinct domains which it shares with other beta chain isomers.

Activins signal through a heteromeric complex of receptor serine kinases which include at least two type I ( I and IB) and two type II (II and IIB) receptors. These receptors are all transmembrane proteins, composed of a ligand-binding extracellular domain with cysteine-rich region, a transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic domain with predicted serine/threonine specificity. Type I receptors are essential for signaling; and type II receptors are required for binding ligands and for expression of type I receptors. Type I and II receptors form a stable complex after ligand binding, resulting in phosphorylation of type I receptors by type II receptors. This gene encodes activin A type I receptor which signals a particular transcriptional response in concert with activin type II receptors. Mutations in this gene are associated with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressive. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

4217|MAP3K5|mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 5|Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades include MAPK or extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), MAPK kinase (MKK or MEK), and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK or MEKK). MAPKK kinase/MEKK phosphorylates and activates its downstream protein kinase, MAPK kinase/MEK, which in turn activates MAPK. The kinases of these signaling cascades are highly conserved, and homologs exist in yeast, Drosophila, and mammalian cells. MAPKKK5 contains 1,374 amino acids with all 11 kinase subdomains. Northern blot analysis shows that MAPKKK5 transcript is abundantly expressed in human heart and pancreas. The MAPKKK5 protein phosphorylates and activates MKK4 (aliases SERK1, MAPKK4) in vitro, and activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) during transient expression in COS and 293 cells; MAPKKK5 does not activate MAPK/ERK.

Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. The protein encoded by this gene is the alpha-5 subunit of of laminin-10 (laminin-511), laminin-11 (laminin-521) and laminin-15 (laminin-523). [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2013]

3915|LAMC1|laminin subunit gamma 1|Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins, composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively), have a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 1. The gamma 1 chain, formerly thought to be a beta chain, contains structural domains similar to beta chains, however, lacks the short alpha region separating domains I and II. The structural organization of this gene also suggested that it had diverged considerably from the beta chain genes. Embryos of transgenic mice in which both alleles of the gamma 1 chain gene were inactivated by homologous recombination, lacked basement membranes, indicating that laminin, gamma 1 chain is necessary for laminin heterotrimer assembly. It has been inferred by analogy with the strikingly similar 3' UTR sequence in mouse laminin gamma 1 cDNA, that multiple polyadenylation sites are utilized in human to generate the 2 different sized mRNAs (5.5 and 7.5 kb) seen on Northern analysis.

3064|HTT|huntingtin|Huntingtin is a disease gene linked to Huntington's disease, a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons. This is thought to be caused by an expanded, unstable trinucleotide repeat in the huntingtin gene, which translates as a polyglutamine repeat in the protein product. A fairly broad range of trinucleotide repeats (9-35) has been identified in normal controls, and repeat numbers in excess of 40 have been described as pathological. The huntingtin locus is large, spanning 180 kb and consisting of 67 exons. The huntingtin gene is widely expressed and is required for normal development. It is expressed as 2 alternatively polyadenylated forms displaying different relative abundance in various fetal and adult tissues. The larger transcript is approximately 13.7 kb and is expressed predominantly in adult and fetal brain whereas the smaller transcript of approximately 10.3 kb is more widely expressed. The genetic defect leading to Huntington's disease may not necessarily eliminate transcription, but may confer a new property on the mRNA or alter the function of the protein. One candidate is the huntingtin-associated protein-1, highly expressed in brain, which has increased affinity for huntingtin protein with expanded polyglutamine repeats.

Arrestin beta 1 is a cytosolic protein and acts as a cofactor in the beta-adrenergic receptor kinase (BARK) mediated desensitization of beta-adrenergic receptors.

5728|PTEN|phosphatase and tensin homolog|This gene was identified as a tumor suppressor that is mutated in a large number of cancers at high frequency. The protein encoded by this gene is a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase. It contains a tensin like domain as well as a catalytic domain similar to that of the dual specificity protein tyrosine phosphatases. Unlike most of the protein tyrosine phosphatases, this protein preferentially dephosphorylates phosphoinositide substrates. It negatively regulates intracellular levels of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate in cells and functions as a tumor suppressor by negatively regulating AKT/PKB signaling pathway. The use of a non-canonical (CUG) upstream initiation site produces a longer isoform that initiates translation with a leucine, and is thought to be preferentially associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This longer isoform may help regulate energy metabolism in the mitochondria. A pseudogene of this gene is found on chromosome 9.

207|AKT1|AKT serine/threonine kinase 1|This gene encodes one of the three members of the human AKT serine-threonine protein kinase family which are often referred to as protein kinase B alpha, beta, and gamma. These highly similar AKT proteins all have an N-terminal pleckstrin homology domain, a serine/threonine-specific kinase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain. These proteins are phosphorylated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). AKT/PI3K forms a key component of many signalling pathways that involve the binding of membrane-bound ligands such as receptor tyrosine kinases, G-protein coupled receptors, and integrin-linked kinase. These AKT proteins therefore regulate a wide variety of cellular functions including cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, and angiogenesis in both normal and malignant cells. AKT proteins are recruited to the cell membrane by phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) after phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by PI3K. Subsequent phosphorylation of both threonine residue 308 and serine residue 473 is required for full activation of the AKT1 protein encoded by this gene. Phosphorylation of additional residues also occurs, for example, in response to insulin growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor. Protein phosphatases act as negative regulators of AKT proteins by dephosphorylating AKT or PIP3. The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is crucial for tumor cell survival. Survival factors can suppress apoptosis in a transcription-independent manner by activating AKT1 which then phosphorylates and inactivates components of the apoptotic machinery. AKT proteins also participate in the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway which controls the assembly of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4E) complex and this pathway, in addition to responding to extracellular signals from growth factors and cytokines, is disregulated in many cancers. Mutations in this gene are associated with multiple types of cancer and excessive tissue growth including Proteus syndrome and Cowden syndrome 6, and breast, colorectal, and ovarian cancers. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2020]

4087|SMAD2|SMAD family member 2|The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the SMAD, a family of proteins similar to the gene products of the Drosophila gene 'mothers against decapentaplegic' (Mad) and the C. elegans gene Sma. SMAD proteins are signal transducers and transcriptional modulators that mediate multiple signaling pathways. This protein mediates the signal of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, and thus regulates multiple cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation.

23560|GTPBP4|GTP binding protein 4|GTP-binding proteins are GTPases and function as molecular switches that can flip between two states: active, when GTP is bound, and inactive, when GDP is bound. 'Active' in this context usually means that the molecule acts as a signal to trigger other events in the cell. When an extracellular ligand binds to a G-protein-linked receptor, the receptor changes its conformation and switches on the trimeric G proteins that associate with it by causing them to eject their GDP and replace it with GTP. The switch is turned off when the G protein hydrolyzes its own bound GTP, converting it back to GDP. But before that occurs, the active protein has an opportunity to diffuse away from the receptor and deliver its message for a prolonged period to its downstream target. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

The RGS domain of this protein interacts with G alpha(s), accelerates its GTP hydrolysis, and attenuates G alpha(s)-mediated signaling. Overexpression of this protein delayes lysosomal degradation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. Because of its bifunctional role, this protein may link heterotrimeric G protein signaling and vesicular trafficking. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

43|ACHE|acetylcholinesterase (Cartwright blood group)|Acetylcholinesterase hydrolyzes the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine at neuromuscular junctions and brain cholinergic synapses, and thus terminates signal transmission. It is also found on the red blood cell membranes, where it constitutes the Yt blood group antigen. Acetylcholinesterase exists in multiple molecular forms which possess similar catalytic properties, but differ in their oligomeric assembly and mode of cell attachment to the cell surface. It is encoded by the single ACHE gene, and the structural diversity in the gene products arises from alternative mRNA splicing, and post-translational associations of catalytic and structural subunits. The major form of acetylcholinesterase found in brain, muscle and other tissues is the hydrophilic species, which forms disulfide-linked oligomers with collagenous, or lipid-containing structural subunits. The other, alternatively spliced form, expressed primarily in the erythroid tissues, differs at the C-terminal end, and contains a cleavable hydrophobic peptide with a GPI-anchor site. It associates with the membranes through the phosphoinositide (PI) moieties added post-translationally.

3717|JAK2|Janus kinase 2|This gene encodes a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cytokine and growth factor signalling. The primary isoform of this protein has an N-terminal FERM domain that is required for erythropoietin receptor association, an SH2 domain that binds STAT transcription factors, a pseudokinase domain and a C-terminal tyrosine kinase domain. Cytokine binding induces autophosphorylation and activation of this kinase. This kinase then recruits and phosphorylates signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins. Growth factors like TGF-beta 1 also induce phosphorylation and activation of this kinase and translocation of downstream STAT proteins to the nucleus where they influence gene transcription. Mutations in this gene are associated with numerous inflammatory diseases and malignancies. This gene is a downstream target of the pleiotropic cytokine IL6 that is produced by B cells, T cells, dendritic cells and macrophages to produce an immune response or inflammation. Disregulation of the IL6/JAK2/STAT3 signalling pathways produces increased cellular proliferation and myeloproliferative neoplasms of hematopoietic stem cells. A nonsynonymous mutation in the pseudokinase domain of this gene disrupts the domains inhibitory effect and results in constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation activity and hypersensitivity to cytokine signalling.

3091|HIF1A|hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha|This gene encodes the alpha subunit of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1), which is a heterodimer composed of an alpha and a beta subunit. HIF-1 functions as a master regulator of cellular and systemic homeostatic response to hypoxia by activating transcription of many genes, including those involved in energy metabolism, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and other genes whose protein products increase oxygen delivery or facilitate metabolic adaptation to hypoxia. HIF-1 thus plays an essential role in embryonic vascularization, tumor angiogenesis and pathophysiology of ischemic disease.

5696|PSMB8|proteasome 20S subunit beta 8|The proteasome is a multicatalytic proteinase complex with a highly ordered ring-shaped 20S core structure. The core structure is composed of 4 rings of 28 non-identical subunits; 2 rings are composed of 7 alpha subunits and 2 rings are composed of 7 beta subunits. Proteasomes are distributed throughout eukaryotic cells at a high concentration and cleave peptides in an ATP/ubiquitin-dependent process in a non-lysosomal pathway. An essential function of a modified proteasome, the immunoproteasome, is the processing of class I MHC peptides. This gene encodes a member of the proteasome B-type family, also known as the T1B family, that is a 20S core beta subunit. This gene is located in the class II region of the MHC (major histocompatibility complex). Expression of this gene is induced by gamma interferon and this gene product replaces catalytic subunit 3 (proteasome beta 5 subunit) in the immunoproteasome.

This gene is a member of the vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)/synaptobrevin family. Because of its high homology to other known VAMPs, its broad tissue distribution, and its subcellular localization, the protein encoded by this gene was shown to be the human equivalent of the rodent cellubrevin.

55294|FBXW7|F-box and WD repeat domain containing 7|This gene encodes a member of the F-box protein family which is characterized by an approximately 40 amino acid motif, the F-box. The F-box proteins constitute one of the four subunits of ubiquitin protein ligase complex called SCFs (SKP1-cullin-F-box), which function in phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination. The F-box proteins are divided into 3 classes: Fbws containing WD-40 domains, Fbls containing leucine-rich repeats, and Fbxs containing either different protein-protein interaction modules or no recognizable motifs. The protein encoded by this gene was previously referred to as FBX30, and belongs to the Fbws class; in addition to an F-box, this protein contains 7 tandem WD40 repeats.

22920|KIFAP3|kinesin associated protein 3|The small G protein GDP dissociation stimulator (smg GDS) is a regulator protein having two activities on a group of small G proteins including the Rho and Rap1 family members and Ki-Ras; one is to stimulate their GDP/GTP exchange reactions, and the other is to inhibit their interactions with membranes. The protein encoded by this gene contains 9 'Armadillo' repeats and interacts with the smg GDS protein through these repeats. This protein, which is highly concentrated around the endoplasmic reticulum, is phosphorylated by v-src, and this phosphorylation reduces the affinity of the protein for smg GDS. It is thought that this protein serves as a linker between human chromosome-associated polypeptide (HCAP) and KIF3A/B, a kinesin superfamily protein in the nucleus, and that it plays a role in the interaction of chromosomes with an ATPase motor protein. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]
7077|TIMP2|TIMP metallopeptidase inhibitor 2|This gene is a member of the TIMP gene family.

The peroxisomal biogenesis disorders are a heterogeneous group with at least 14 complementation groups and with more than 1 phenotype being observed in cases falling into particular complementation groups. Although the clinical features of PBD patients vary, cells from all PBD patients exhibit a defect in the import of one or more classes of peroxisomal matrix proteins into the organelle.

2683|B4GALT1|beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase 1|This gene is one of seven beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (beta4GalT) genes. They encode type II membrane-bound glycoproteins that appear to have exclusive specificity for the donor substrate UDP-galactose; all transfer galactose in a beta1,4 linkage to similar acceptor sugars: GlcNAc, Glc, and Xyl. Each beta4GalT has a distinct function in the biosynthesis of different glycoconjugates and saccharide structures. As type II membrane proteins, they have an N-terminal hydrophobic signal sequence that directs the protein to the Golgi apparatus and which then remains uncleaved to function as a transmembrane anchor. By sequence similarity, the beta4GalTs form four groups: beta4GalT1 and beta4GalT2, beta4GalT3 and beta4GalT4, beta4GalT5 and beta4GalT6, and beta4GalT7. This gene is unique among the beta4GalT genes because it encodes an enzyme that participates both in glycoconjugate and lactose biosynthesis. For the first activity, the enzyme adds galactose to N-acetylglucosamine residues that are either monosaccharides or the nonreducing ends of glycoprotein carbohydrate chains. The second activity is restricted to lactating mammary tissues where the enzyme forms a heterodimer with alpha-lactalbumin to catalyze UDP-galactose + D-glucose <=> UDP + lactose.

51738|GHRL|ghrelin and obestatin prepropeptide|This gene encodes the ghrelin-obestatin preproprotein that is cleaved to yield two peptides, ghrelin and obestatin. Ghrelin is a powerful appetite stimulant and plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Its secretion is initiated when the stomach is empty, whereupon it binds to the growth hormone secretagogue receptor in the hypothalamus which results in the secretion of growth hormone (somatotropin). Ghrelin is thought to regulate multiple activities, including hunger, reward perception via the mesolimbic pathway, gastric acid secretion, gastrointestinal motility, and pancreatic glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. It was initially proposed that obestatin plays an opposing role to ghrelin by promoting satiety and thus decreasing food intake, but this action is still debated.

It has been found that upon accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the mRNA of this gene is processed to an active form by an unconventional splicing mechanism that is mediated by the endonuclease inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1). The resulting loss of 26 nt from the spliced mRNA causes a frame-shift and an isoform XBP1(S), which is the functionally active transcription factor. The isoform encoded by the unspliced mRNA, XBP1(U), is constitutively expressed, and thought to function as a negative feedback regulator of XBP1(S), which shuts off transcription of target genes during the recovery phase of ER stress. A pseudogene of XBP1 has been identified and localized to chromosome 5. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]

This growth factor induces proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells, and is essential for both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Disruption of this gene in mice resulted in abnormal embryonic blood vessel formation. This gene is upregulated in many known tumors and its expression is correlated with tumor stage and progression. Elevated levels of this protein are found in patients with POEMS syndrome, also known as Crow-Fukase syndrome. Allelic variants of this gene have been associated with microvascular complications of diabetes 1 (MVCD1) and atherosclerosis. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. There is also evidence for alternative translation initiation from upstream non-AUG (CUG) codons resulting in additional isoforms. A recent study showed that a C-terminally extended isoform is produced by use of an alternative in-frame translation termination codon via a stop codon readthrough mechanism, and that this isoform is antiangiogenic. Expression of some isoforms derived from the AUG start codon is regulated by a small upstream open reading frame, which is located within an internal ribosome entry site. The levels of VEGF are increased during infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), thus promoting inflammation by facilitating recruitment of inflammatory cells, and by increasing the level of angiopoietin II (Ang II), one of two products of the SARS-CoV-2 binding target, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). In turn, Ang II facilitates the elevation of VEGF, thus forming a vicious cycle in the release of inflammatory cytokines. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2020]
